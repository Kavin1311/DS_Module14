# Ex7 Priority Queue
## DATE: 25/4/2025
## AIM:
To formulate the C code to display the elements of the priority queue after insertion and deletion operation.

## Algorithm
Start
1.Define a function printArray() that takes an array and its size as parameters.
2.Loop through the array from index 0 to size-1.
3.Print each element of the array during the loop.
4.After printing all elements, print a newline for formatting.
5.End
## Program:
/*

/*#include<stdio.h> int size = 0;
*/
voidprintArray(int array[], int size)
{
int i; for(i=0;i<size;i++)
{
printf("%d ",array[i]);
}
printf("\n");
}
```
